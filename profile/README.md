## Overview
The **Band Manager Application** is a web-based tool designed to help bands and their managers efficiently organize events, bookings, and band-related activities. With role-based access control, users such as band managers, members, and site administrators can create and manage band profiles, schedule performances, and handle logistical details like soundcheck times, set lists, venue information, and task assignments.
